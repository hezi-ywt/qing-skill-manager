### 🍎 macOS Security Note

Since Apple developer commercial signature is not configured yet, opening the app for the first time may trigger "App is damaged and can't be opened" or "from an unidentified developer" warnings. You can run the following terminal command to bypass it:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/skills-manager-gui.app"
```
